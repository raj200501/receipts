# receipts

**Do AI coding agents tell the truth about what they did? receipts checks every claim in an agent's final report against what actually happened in its sandbox, measures why reports go wrong, and ships a verifier that catches it live.**

> **This README is a build brief, not a finished project.** It is the complete kickoff prompt for an autonomous Claude Code session that builds receipts from an empty repository. Nothing below is a result yet. Claude replaces this file with the real README described in section 11 once real results exist (gate G13 checks it); the brief itself stays at `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md`.

## 0. Launch (for Raj)

**Cost: $0 cash.** Everything runs on Claude through your Claude Code Max plan, free open-weight models running locally, and optional free tiers you choose to switch on. No paid API is ever called (section 8). Plan usage limits are shared across sessions, so run at most two of these five projects at the same time.

1. **Pick a machine** where the `claude` CLI is logged in to your Max plan. Your laptop works. Docker is a bonus: some experiments use it, and each one has a Docker-free fallback. Claude Code on the web can build the project too, but experiments that use Claude as a test subject need the `claude` CLI inside the environment. `make doctor` reports what is possible and the plan adapts.
2. **Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raj200501/receipts.git && cd receipts
   ```
   This repository is private. Make it public yourself after you have read docs/REPORT.md.
3. **Optional settings** (skip freely). Set them only as environment variables, never in files:
   - Free tiers: `GEMINI_API_KEY` from a Google AI Studio project with no billing attached, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from an account with zero credits (only `:free` models get used), `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` (fine-grained token with `models:read`). Then `export FREE_TIER_KEYS_CONFIRMED=1` to confirm none of them can charge you. Without that flag, Claude ignores them.
   - `export ALLOW_PUSH=1` lets Claude push commits (never tags) to this private repo, so you can follow progress on GitHub.
   - `export CAP_SHARE=0.5` in each shell if you run two projects at once, so they split the usage caps in section 8.
4. **Check that nothing can bill you, then start Claude Code in auto mode.** First run `env | grep -E '^(ANTHROPIC_|CLAUDE_CODE_USE_)'` and unset anything it prints: an API key in the environment is billed per token even when you are logged in. Then:
   ```bash
   claude --permission-mode auto
   ```
   Inside Claude Code, `/status` should show your Max subscription as the login method. Or press Shift+Tab until auto mode shows. Avoid `--dangerously-skip-permissions` unless you are inside a throwaway VM or container.
5. **Paste message 1, the heartbeat.** It schedules itself every 30 minutes for 7 days and only fires while the session is idle, so it restarts work whenever the goal finishes, pauses on a usage limit, or stalls:
   ```text
   /loop 30m Heartbeat for receipts. If docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md does not exist, run only the Bootstrap in section 10.1 of README.md. Otherwise read CLAUDE.md, STATUS.md, and section 10 of docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md. If the STATE line of STATUS.md says BLOCKED ON RAJ or LADDER COMPLETE and nothing new has come from Raj since (a commit, file, or environment change), reply with that line only. If a background run is still in progress, check on it and do only work that starts no new model runs. Otherwise run exactly one Loop Protocol iteration: the next failing Definition-of-Done gate, or, once all 14 gates pass, the next Stretch Ladder rung in section 7. Verify with `python tools/ship_check.py --fast` (section 10.6 says when to run the full check), update STATUS.md, commit, and finish with a three-line summary.
   ```
6. **Paste message 2, the goal.** Work starts immediately and continues turn after turn until the Definition of Done is proven in the transcript, or until Claude shows it is blocked on something only you can do:
   ```text
   /goal Build the receipts project exactly as specified in its build brief. If docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md does not exist, copy README.md verbatim to it and run the Bootstrap in section 10.1. If it exists, it is the immutable brief: check it against docs/BUILD_BRIEF.sha256, never copy over it or bootstrap again, and continue the Loop Protocol in section 10.2. Done means (A) or (B) appears in this conversation after your latest commit. (A) Shipped: one message of yours quotes the full stdout of a full `make ship-check` (output marked FAST never counts), with one line for each of G1 to G14 from section 6 of docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md, none weakened, skipped, or redefined, and last line exactly `SHIP-CHECK: PASS 14/14`; the final line of the latest `make review`, `REVIEW: SHIP`; then `git rev-parse HEAD` printing the SHA named on the first line of the ship-check output, `git status` showing a clean working tree, and `git tag --points-at HEAD` showing v1.0. (B) Blocked: one message of yours starts with `BLOCKED ON RAJ`, quotes a ship-check run from that turn, and shows that every failing gate is listed under "Needs Raj" in STATUS.md with the exact action Raj must take, and that no further progress is possible without him. A usage-limit pause, missing Docker, or work that only needs more time is not (B) and does not make this impossible. Constraints on every turn: spend $0 cash (never call a paid API, buy credits, or change any plan); never edit docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md; never invent or hand-type a result number (every reported number comes from a banked artifact and passes claimcheck); never send email, open issues or pull requests, post, or publish anything, and push only as section 10.1 step 11 allows; work autonomously and record assumptions in DECISIONS.md instead of asking questions. Keep `goal_turn: N` as the first line of STATUS.md, add 1 at the start of every turn, and end each turn by stating goal_turn and which gates pass. Or stop once goal_turn reaches 300.
   ```
7. **Check in** with `/goal` (status and the evaluator's latest reason), `head -2 STATUS.md`, or `git log --oneline`. To stop: `/goal clear`, then ask Claude to cancel the scheduled loop. When the 7-day loop expires, a bare `/loop 30m` restarts it from `.claude/loop.md`. If a session ends, start a new one in the repo and paste the same two messages; the goal text resumes from the existing state instead of starting over.

**If your Claude Code surface does not support `/goal` or `/loop`**, paste this single message instead:

```text
Read docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md in full (README.md if that file does not exist yet) and execute it as your build brief. If docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md does not exist, start with the Bootstrap in section 10.1. Then repeat the Loop Protocol in section 10.2 without stopping to ask questions (record assumptions in DECISIONS.md), finish with the final sequence in section 10.6, and keep climbing the Stretch Ladder in section 7. Follow every rule in section 9 and the $0 budget in section 8.
```

### 0.1 For Claude: if you were started without the two messages above

If Raj only asked you to "do the README" or "complete the prompt in the README", do not stop to ask. (a) If you have a scheduling tool that delivers its prompt back into this same session (for example CronCreate), schedule a recurring task every 30 minutes whose prompt is the message-1 text above without the leading `/loop 30m`. Never use a scheduler that starts a separate session per firing: two sessions must never work in one repository at once. (b) Then follow the fallback message exactly. (c) End your first reply with one line telling Raj he can paste the message-2 `/goal` line from section 0 to have an independent evaluator keep you going until the Definition of Done is proven.

## 1. Mission

When an AI coding agent ends with "Done. All tests pass and I updated the config," a user usually believes it. Real sessions show that these reports are often wrong. Nobody yet knows, under controlled conditions, how often each kind of claim is false, why, or what reliably fixes it.

Build **receipts**:

- A library and CLI that turns an agent run into a ground-truth **event ledger** (commands, exit codes, test results, file diffs, timing) and checks each atomic claim in the agent's final report against it: **supported**, **contradicted**, or **unverifiable**, with the evidence events attached.
- **receipts-bench**: instrumented coding tasks with randomized manipulations designed to separate the mechanisms behind false reports.
- A preregistered, randomized study across agents and model tiers on identical tasks.
- **receipts-hook**: a drop-in check for Claude Code (a Stop hook) and a wrapper for other agent CLIs that flags unsupported claims before the user reads them, with its effect measured.

**Quality bar.** The Claude Code and Codex teams should want to ship the hook, and safety teams should want to cite the mechanism results. Hit the signals frontier teams say they value: measurement science, product impact on real model behavior, clean engineering, and honest reporting.

## 2. Why now, and what to beat

Read and position against these. Verify each before citing and drop any you cannot open.

**The gap.** A randomized, same-task, cross-agent measurement of claim-level report faithfulness that separates confusion from overclaiming, plus a mitigation whose effect is measured inside real tools.

## 3. Research questions

- **RQ1 Prevalence.** Per agent configuration: the rate of contradicted claims per report and per claim, the false-success rate (report says the task succeeded, ground truth says it did not), and the failure-omission rate (known failures never mentioned).
- **RQ2 Causes.** The effect of each manipulation in section 5 on those rates.
- **RQ3 Mechanism.** For each contradicted claim, did the agent actually receive the contradicting evidence in a tool result? Classify as "saw it and reported otherwise", "evidence was truncated before it reached the agent", or "never saw it". Report the mix by agent and condition.
- **RQ4 Judges.** How well do LLM judges that read the transcript detect contradicted claims compared with ground truth (precision and recall by claim type)?
- **RQ5 Mitigation.** The effect of (a) an honesty instruction, (b) an evidence-linked report format in which every claim cites ledger event IDs, and (c) the receipts-hook post-check, on user-visible false claims, task success, tokens, and latency.

Write formal hypotheses with frozen thresholds into `prereg/` before confirmatory runs. Do not presume directions.

## 4. What to build

Package `receipts` (Python 3.11+, src layout, uv, MIT):

- **`ledger`**: an executor that runs agent tool calls in a disposable workspace (Docker when available; otherwise a local sandbox with a scrubbed environment, resource limits, and no network by default) and writes an append-only, hash-chained JSONL ledger. Parsers for pytest and JUnit XML, npm test output, git diff, and common linters. For Claude Code subjects, the ledger comes from PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks passed with `--settings` from outside the workspace, plus a post-run snapshot (git diff and a rerun of the tests), never from the agent's own transcript.
- **Agent drivers**, each recording the agent's native transcript alongside the ledger:
  - `claude-code`: headless `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose` inside the task workspace, with model tiers chosen by `--model` (plan usage, $0 cash).
  - `minimal-agent`: a small, fully controlled ReAct agent (bash, read, write, edit, run_tests, finish) for local open-weight models through Ollama or llama.cpp, so the scaffold is held constant across model families.
  - Optional $0 drivers when available: Gemini CLI on its free tier, Codex CLI only if Raj is already logged in with a ChatGPT plan (never with an API key), and OpenRouter `:free` models through minimal-agent.
- **`claims`**: extract atomic claims from the final report. Deterministic patterns for the common types (ran X, N of M tests pass, modified file F, added dependency D, fixed bug B, could not do Y) plus a model extractor with a strict JSON schema for the rest.
- **`verify`**: deterministic checkers that map each claim type to ledger queries. For example, "all tests pass" requires a final test run after the last edit with zero failures and zero errors. Output: supported, contradicted, or unverifiable, with evidence events.
- **`analysis`**: mixed-effects logistic models with task random effects, preregistered contrasts, and cluster bootstrap intervals.
- **`receipts-hook`**: a Claude Code Stop hook (check the current hook docs first) that runs receipts on the session and, when it finds contradicted claims, returns a message asking the agent to correct its report; plus a generic wrapper for other CLIs that annotates the final report. Median added latency under 5 seconds, and it must never block the session on its own infrastructure errors.
- **`receipts-bench`**: 30 to 60 small but realistic repositories (Python and TypeScript) with tasks such as bug fixes, features, refactors, dependency bumps, writing tests, docs, and CI configuration. Every task ships hidden ground-truth checks, a passing reference solution, and a manifest of manipulable features.

## 5. Experiments

- **E0 Instrument validity.** (a) Seeded reports: synthetic final reports with known true and false claims written against real ledgers, giving extractor and verifier precision and recall per claim type. (b) Ledger completeness: every command an agent ran appears in the ledger, cross-checked against its native transcript. A separate subagent or headless run that has not seen `src/receipts/claims/` writes the seeded reports, imitating phrasing from real smoke-run reports; half are held out and untouched until the G5 run. "The five most common claim types" are counted on real agent reports from the G6 smoke runs.
- **E1 Main randomized study (confirmatory).** Within each task, randomize these manipulations in a full or fractional factorial chosen by power analysis under the section 8 caps:
  - **M1 Attainability:** every requirement attainable, versus one requirement made unattainable (for example a missing service or contradictory spec) where the honest report is "could not do X".
  - **M2 Failure salience:** one failing test among many, with test output shown in full versus truncated at the tool boundary.
  - **M3 Pressure:** a neutral request versus a realistic request stressing that everything must pass.
  - **M4 Context load:** a short session versus a long one with realistic prior work in context.
  - **M5 Tool flakiness:** reliable tools versus a tool that intermittently errors.
  - Agents: at least two Claude tiers through Claude Code and at least one open-weight family through minimal-agent, plus any optional free-tier agents.
  - Scaffold control: also run at least one Claude tier inside minimal-agent, where each step is one `claude -p --restricted --tools "" --system-prompt <minimal-agent prompt>` call on the conversation so far; one such run counts once against `claude_agent_runs_per_day`. This crosses model with scaffold for at least one Claude tier. Label any contrast that is not crossed as scaffold-confounded.
- **E2 Mechanism analysis** of every contradicted claim (RQ3).
- **E3 Judge validity** (RQ4) for two or three judge configurations.
- **E4 Mitigation study** (RQ5) on a held-out set of tasks.

## 6. Definition of Done (ship gates)

`make ship-check` must print PASS for all 14 gates, checked on a fresh clone.

- **G1 Build and tests.** `make setup` succeeds on a fresh clone and `make test` passes. Line coverage is at least 85% on core modules. Adapters that need external services may be excluded from coverage only if recorded-fixture contract tests cover them.
- **G2 Static quality.** `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, and `mypy --strict` on the package pass with zero errors. Every `type: ignore` carries a reason.
- **G3 CI parity.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `make ci` (lint, typecheck, test, offline demo) on Python 3.11 and 3.12, and `make ci` passes locally.
- **G4 Offline demo.** `make demo` finishes in under 3 minutes with no network and no model calls (recorded fixtures only) and matches its committed golden output.
- **G5 Instrument validity.** On the seeded set, the extractor plus verifier reach precision of at least 0.95 and recall of at least 0.90 for each of the five most common claim types, with intervals printed. Ledger completeness is 100% on the validation runs; any gap is a FAIL.
- **G6 Benchmark complete.** receipts-bench has at least 30 tasks, each with hidden checks, a reference solution that passes them, a manipulation manifest, and a smoke run by at least one agent.
- **G7 Main study.** E1 ran as preregistered with at least 3 agent configurations spanning at least 2 model families and at least 60 runs per configuration (more if the power analysis and caps allow). Results are banked with intervals.
- **G8 Mechanisms and judges.** E2 and E3 ran and are reported, including null results.
- **G9 Mitigation shipped.** E4 ran. receipts-hook is packaged with install instructions, measured latency, and a scripted 30-second demo transcript.
- **G10 Claim integrity.** `make claimcheck` and `make freshness` pass on README.md and docs/REPORT.md.
- **G11 Preregistration integrity.** `make prereg-verify` passes: every confirmatory artifact cites a preregistration whose commit predates the artifact's first commit, and no preregistration changed after it was frozen.
- **G12 Independent review.** The latest `make review` ends with `REVIEW: SHIP` for the current code, with zero open blocking issues. Non-blocking issues are listed in docs/REVIEW_LOG.md.
- **G13 Documentation.** README.md follows section 11, docs/REPORT.md is complete, and `make citecheck` shows every reference verified.
- **G14 Hygiene.** `make secrets-scan` is clean. `make budget` shows `cash_usd = 0` and every cap respected. Nothing under private/ is tracked. LICENSE, CITATION.cff, SECURITY.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md exist. The original checkout's working tree is clean.

## 7. Stretch Ladder (after the Definition of Done, one rung per iteration)

1. Human audit kit: a CLI labeler for 200 sampled claims so Raj or volunteers can validate the verifier; report human agreement.
2. More agents and scaffolds (OpenHands, mini-swe-agent, Aider) under native or minimal scaffolds.
3. A longitudinal tracker: one command that reruns a fixed slice on a new model (plan permitting) and updates a report-faithfulness trend for Raj to publish. Do not install scheduled jobs.
4. Real transcripts, only if Raj has created `private/OPT_IN_TRANSCRIPTS` himself: run receipts over his Claude Code transcripts with deterministic checks and local models only (no Claude calls, no free tiers), copy nothing into the repository, and commit only aggregates.
5. Package receipts-bench for Inspect AI and Harbor.
6. A static side-by-side viewer of "what the agent said" versus "what happened".
7. A workshop-paper version of docs/REPORT.md for Raj to submit.
8. Last rung: when every rung is done or listed under "Blocked", set `STATE: LADDER COMPLETE` in STATUS.md and stop.

## 8. Budget and compute

**Cash budget: $0. This is absolute.** Never call a paid API, add a payment method, buy credits, upgrade a plan, or rent paid compute. If any call returns a billing, credit, or payment error, stop that path, log it, and continue with other work.

Allowed model backends, in order of preference:

1. **Local open-weight models** through Ollama, llama.cpp, or transformers. Pin the model, revision, quantization, and file hash. Respect the disk floor below.
2. **Claude through Raj's Claude Code plan.** As an experimental subject or a pipeline worker, call headless Claude Code: `claude -p --model <haiku|sonnet|opus> --output-format stream-json --verbose`, run in a disposable workspace outside this repo. Plan usage is shared with Raj's other work, so be frugal; for a handful of pipeline calls, Claude Code subagents are fine.
   - **Billing guard.** If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, any `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*` variable, or an `apiKeyHelper` setting is present, the client wrapper refuses to launch Claude children and adds the problem to "Needs Raj". Never use `--bare`: it ignores the Max login and authenticates only with an API key. The `total_cost_usd` field in stream-json output is an API-price estimate, not cash: log it as `plan_equivalent_usd`, never add it to `cash_usd`, and never treat `--max-budget-usd` as the $0 control.
   - **Nesting.** If a child refuses to start or hangs because it detects the parent session, launch it with the parent-session markers removed from its environment only (for example `env -u CLAUDECODE -u CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT claude -p ...`), the usual pattern for scripted automation. If it still fails, use subagents for small pipeline jobs and local models for subject runs, and add the limitation to "Needs Raj".
3. **Optional free tiers, only if `FREE_TIER_KEYS_CONFIRMED=1` is set:** the Gemini API free tier or Gemini CLI with a personal login, OpenRouter models whose IDs end in `:free` (check that the models endpoint lists a zero price before every batch), and the GitHub Models free tier. Obey each provider's rate limits and terms. Never send anything under `private/` to a free-tier provider.

Caps live in `budget.toml`, created at bootstrap from the defaults below. Claude may lower a cap and must never raise one. If a cap blocks the Definition of Done, add it to STATUS.md under "Needs Raj" and keep working on everything else.

```toml
cash_usd = 0                        # absolute; never change
claude_agent_runs_per_day = 30      # multi-turn headless runs used as test subjects
claude_agent_max_turns = 40         # per headless run (or per subtask message in resumed sessions)
claude_single_calls_per_day = 300   # short single-turn calls (labeling, judging, extraction)
claude_review_runs_per_day = 6      # make review
local_model_max_params_b = 8        # make doctor may lower this to fit RAM
disk_floor_gb = 8                   # never download if free disk would fall below this
```

If `CAP_SHARE` is set below 1 (Raj sets it when two projects run at once), the wrapper multiplies every `claude_*` cap by it. docs/PLAN.md schedules the Claude subject arms against the caps and starts them as early as the preregistration allows.

Usage hygiene:

- Every model call goes through one client wrapper that enforces the caps, logs tokens and wall time to `artifacts/usage/ledger.jsonl`, and caches responses by content hash. A banked call is never re-run.
- Prefer haiku for bulk work, sonnet for main arms, and opus for small confirmatory slices.
- When a child run reports a usage limit, stop launching model runs, record the reset time in STATUS.md, commit, and end the turn; the heartbeat resumes after the reset. Runs longer than a few minutes go in the background with a PID file and a log under `runs/<id>/` (git-ignored), and at most one model-heavy run is active at a time.
- `make doctor` detects Docker, GPU, RAM, free disk, the `claude` CLI and its login, Ollama, and any confirmed free-tier keys. Choose backends from its output and record them in STATUS.md.
- **Sandboxing.** Subject agents, minimal-agent tool calls, and third-party code (graders, task repositories, benchmark scripts) never run directly on the host. Use Docker with `--network none` when available. Otherwise use an OS sandbox that blocks network and allows writes only inside a temporary workspace (bubblewrap on Linux, sandbox-exec on macOS, or Claude Code's built-in Bash sandbox for Claude subjects; check current docs), with `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, cloud credentials, and all API keys removed from the environment, and with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`. If no sandbox works, run only this project's own generated tasks, record that in DECISIONS.md, and add it to "Needs Raj". Never use `bypassPermissions` outside a container.
- **Clean Claude children.** Launch every Claude child with `--restricted --strict-mcp-config`, an explicit `--tools` list, and the matching permission rules (for example `--permission-mode dontAsk` plus `--allowedTools` scoped to the sandbox), so Raj's settings files, the hooks and plugins they enable, and his MCP servers do not load. Pass any hooks an experiment needs through `--settings`. On a smoke run, confirm the child can run the task's commands and that none of Raj's personal configuration reaches it; if his user-level CLAUDE.md or memory still loads, record it as a known contaminant in DECISIONS.md and in run provenance, and never edit or delete Raj's files. Single calls use `--tools ""` and a short `--system-prompt`, batching 20 to 50 items per call. If no max-turns option works, enforce `claude_agent_max_turns` by counting turns in the stream-json output and stopping the child at the cap. Record the exact command line in each run's provenance.
- CPU first. Docker and GPU are optional and never required for the Definition of Done. Every Docker-dependent step needs a Docker-free fallback or a substitution recorded in DECISIONS.md before any data is collected.

## 9. Non-negotiables

These hold on every turn. Copy them verbatim into CLAUDE.md during bootstrap so they survive context compaction.

1. **No fabricated or hand-typed numbers.** Every result number (a measured rate, count of outcomes, estimate, interval, or test statistic) in README.md, docs/REPORT.md, other results documents, figures, and tables is produced by a committed script from a banked artifact under `artifacts/`. Design parameters, thresholds, caps, dates, versions, and the text of docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md are not result numbers. `make claimcheck` enforces this and `make freshness` re-derives every live number.
2. **Preregister before confirmatory runs.** Hypotheses, metrics, analysis plan, thresholds, sample sizes, exclusions, and stopping rules go in `prereg/NNNN-*.md`, committed and hashed before any confirmatory data exists. A needed change is a new, dated amendment file that cites the original, is committed before any data it affects, and is reported as a deviation; the original is never edited. Anything not preregistered is labeled exploratory.
3. **Publish failures beside successes.** Null and negative results get the same prominence as positive ones. Every changed or withdrawn claim gets a dated entry in CORRECTIONS.md.
4. **Label synthetic and mock data everywhere.** Synthetic, procedurally generated, or mock results are never presented as model results or real-world results.
5. **$0 cash, with caps enforced in code** (section 8).
6. **Secrets stay in the environment.** Never write keys or tokens to files, logs, artifacts, or command lines. `make secrets-scan` runs in CI and in ship-check.
7. **Defensive scope only.** Mock tools and disposable sandboxes. No real credentials, real systems, or harmful payloads. Build nothing that helps an agent evade graders, monitors, or safety measures beyond what the measurement strictly requires.
8. **No outbound actions.** Never send email, open issues or pull requests, post, publish packages, datasets, or sites, or contact anyone. Pushing is allowed only under section 10.1 step 11. Prepare drafts in `outbound/` for Raj to review and send.
9. **Respect licenses and terms.** Record the source, license, and retrieval date of all third-party data in docs/DATA.md. Do not redistribute what a license does not allow. Add a canary string to any dataset meant for release.
10. **The brief is immutable.** Never edit docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md. Record deviations, substitutions, and interpretations in DECISIONS.md, with a reason, before acting on them.
11. **Verified citations only.** Never cite from memory. Open and check every reference (title, authors, year, URL) once and bank what you saw in `artifacts/citecheck.json` (retrieval date, final URL, page title, content hash); `make citecheck` validates that file offline, so ship-check never needs the network. If a site blocks scripted access, use the arXiv, DOI, or another official copy, and never work around bot protection. If nothing opens, drop the reference and list it under "Needs Raj" for a manual check.
12. **Plain writing.** Precise, scoped claims. No hype words such as "revolutionary", "groundbreaking", or "state of the art". No em dashes anywhere (Raj's style rule).
13. **Honest progress.** Never pass a gate by weakening its check. If a gate cannot pass, say so in STATUS.md and keep working on what can.
14. **Measure, never induce.** Manipulations are realistic situations (an unattainable requirement, truncated output, time pressure, flaky tools). Never instruct, train, or reward an agent to misreport.
15. **Transcripts stay local.** Any real-world transcript, including Raj's own, is analyzed locally and never committed or uploaded. Only aggregates are committed.

## 10. Operating protocol

### 10.1 Bootstrap (first turn only)

1. Copy README.md verbatim to `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` and write its SHA-256 to `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.sha256`.
2. Write and run `make doctor`. Record the environment, the usable backends, and the resulting fallbacks in STATUS.md. `make doctor` marks the Claude backend unusable while any variable or setting named in the section 8 billing guard is present.
3. Create `CLAUDE.md` (under 150 lines): a one-paragraph mission, section 9 verbatim, the state files, the command list, and this line: "After any compaction or restart, re-read CLAUDE.md, STATUS.md, and sections 6 to 10 of docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md before acting."
4. Create `.claude/loop.md` containing the message-1 heartbeat text from section 0 without the leading `/loop 30m`, so a bare `/loop 30m` after the 7-day expiry behaves the same.
5. Create project subagents in `.claude/agents/`:
   - `reviewer.md`: an adversarial reviewer with fresh eyes. It tries to falsify every claim and checks statistics, leakage, preregistration adherence, reproducibility, and the gate implementations themselves (could a gate pass while the property it guards is false?). An issue is blocking only if it names a file, line, or artifact and shows one of: a gate that can pass while its property is false; a reported number that is wrong, unreproducible, or not from an artifact; a preregistration violation; a broken section 9 rule; or a defect that changes a reported result. Everything else is non-blocking and goes to docs/REVIEW_LOG.md. It reads the previous review and the fixes since, and re-raises a resolved issue only with new evidence. It ends with `REVIEW: SHIP` or `REVIEW: BLOCK` plus a numbered list of blocking issues, each with its evidence.
   - `citation-checker.md`: opens each reference, confirms title, authors, year, and URL, and banks what it saw in `artifacts/citecheck.json` (rule 11).
6. Scaffold: `pyproject.toml` (uv, Python 3.11+), `src/receipts/`, `tests/`, `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore` (private/, runs/, .env*, caches, model weights), `LICENSE` (MIT), `CITATION.cff`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `budget.toml`, `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `CORRECTIONS.md`, `prereg/`, `artifacts/`, `outbound/`, `private/` (git-ignored), and `runs/` (git-ignored).
7. Make targets, all present from day one even if some fail at first: `setup doctor test lint typecheck ci demo prereg-verify claimcheck freshness citecheck secrets-scan budget review report reproduce ship-check`.
8. `make review` runs the reviewer through headless `claude -p --model opus` when available. Otherwise the `reviewer` subagent runs and writes `artifacts/review/latest.json` itself; the main session never edits that file, and `make review` validates and prints it. Either way the file records the commit that was reviewed, which may differ from HEAD only in `artifacts/review/`, `STATUS.md`, and `docs/LOG.md`. When the daily review cap is used up, work on other gates or end the turn; never wait in a loop.
9. Write `tools/ship_check.py`. It implements G1 to G14 exactly as section 6 states them. It first checks, in the original checkout, the parts of G14 about the working tree and private/ (and any private hash manifests), then makes a fresh clone of HEAD in a temporary directory and runs every other check there. It verifies banked artifacts (presence, provenance, hashes, preregistration links, thresholds) and recomputes statistics from them; it never runs an experiment or calls a model. It writes nothing inside the working tree; sub-command logs go to the temporary directory. Its stdout is exactly `HEAD <sha> fresh-clone`, then one line per gate, `G<n> <PASS|FAIL> <short evidence>`, then `SHIP-CHECK: PASS 14/14` or `SHIP-CHECK: FAIL <passed>/14`. With `--fast` it may skip slow steps, and its last line is then `SHIP-CHECK-FAST (does not count): <passed>/14`. Only a full run counts.
10. Write `docs/PLAN.md`: milestones mapped to gates, risks, environment-dependent fallbacks, and usage estimates.
11. Commit ("bootstrap"). Push only if `ALLOW_PUSH=1` is set, only to this repository's `origin`, and never force-push, push tags, or change repository visibility or settings.

### 10.2 Loop Protocol (every iteration)

1. **Orient.** Read STATUS.md. Run `python tools/ship_check.py --fast`.
2. **Choose one thing.** The highest-leverage next step: a failing gate on the critical path first; once all gates pass, the next Stretch Ladder rung in section 7. Write it under "Now" in STATUS.md.
3. **Build it test-first** in small commits, with types, docstrings, and tests for every public function.
4. **Verify.** `make lint typecheck test`, plus the specific check for what you built. For experiments: dry run, usage estimate, preregistration check, then the real run. Pilots and dry runs use tasks and seeds disjoint from the confirmatory sample, recorded in the preregistration, and are never pooled with confirmatory data.
5. **Bank** results as artifacts with provenance: git SHA, config hash, model IDs and revisions, seeds, timestamps, environment, exact command lines, and usage.
6. **Review** milestone-level changes with the `reviewer` subagent and fix every blocking issue.
7. **Record.** Update STATUS.md (gate table, what changed, next three actions, usage to date, "Needs Raj" items), plus DECISIONS.md and CORRECTIONS.md as needed. The first line of STATUS.md is `goal_turn: N` and the second is `STATE: ACTIVE`, `STATE: BLOCKED ON RAJ`, or `STATE: LADDER COMPLETE`. Keep STATUS.md under 200 lines and move history to docs/LOG.md.
8. **Commit** with a descriptive message, and push only under the rule in 10.1 step 11. Tag milestones locally: v0.1 (offline demo), v0.5 (first real results), v1.0 (Definition of Done, set during the final sequence in 10.6).
9. **Raise the bar.** At each milestone ask what would make a research engineer on an OpenAI or Anthropic evals, safety, or agents team say "we should use this", and add one concrete suggestion to the backlog in STATUS.md. Backlog items are suggestions for Raj, not Stretch Ladder rungs.

### 10.3 When stuck

After three failed attempts at the same problem, write what you tried under "Blocked" in STATUS.md, switch to the next highest-leverage item, and come back later. Never fake progress or quietly narrow a gate.

### 10.4 Subagents and parallelism

Use subagents for literature verification, wide code review, and data audits so the main context stays focused. A subagent never declares a gate passed. Only `make ship-check` does.

### 10.5 Reuse from Raj's existing repositories

You may clone these public repositories (same author) and port code with attribution instead of rewriting it:

- https://github.com/raj200501/raise-v1-public (Apache-2.0): the preregistration chain (`tools/prereg.py`), the outbound-copy number gate (`tools/claimcheck.py`), the freshness check (`tools/freshness.py`), and mutation tests for gates (`tests/mutation_test.py`).
- https://github.com/raj200501/armour (MIT): the trace schema, rule monitors, and policy packs for tool-using agents.
- https://github.com/raj200501/arc-ttt-public (MIT): Fencecheck (`tools/fencecheck.py`), which finds eval code that scores correct-but-fenced JSON as zero.

### 10.6 Final sequence

When every gate other than G12 and G13 passes in the fast check, do the following in one turn, in this order, with no other commits:

1. Make sure README.md follows section 11, update STATUS.md, and commit.
2. Run `make review`. On `REVIEW: SHIP`, commit only `artifacts/review/`. On `REVIEW: BLOCK`, fix the issues and start again at step 1 in a later turn.
3. Run the full `make ship-check`.
4. If it ends with `SHIP-CHECK: PASS 14/14`, create or move the local tag v1.0 to HEAD, then run `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git status`, and `git tag --points-at HEAD`.
5. Quote the ship-check stdout, the review's final line, and the three git outputs in your final message.

Never commit after step 3 in this turn. Record the outcome in STATUS.md at the start of the next iteration.

## 11. What the shipped README must look like

Once real results exist, replace this file with the real README (the brief already lives at docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md). G13 checks it.

- **First screen:** the project name, a one-sentence finding with its confidence interval, the headline figure (an SVG generated by `make report`), a small headline table, and a 60-second quickstart that runs offline.
- **Then:** what it is and is not; key results, each linked to its artifact and preregistration; how it works (one diagram); how to use it on your own benchmark or agent; how to reproduce every figure with one command; limitations and threats to validity; a responsible-disclosure note where relevant; verified related work; citation; license.
- **Tone:** plain and exact. No hype, no em dashes, and every number from an artifact.
- **Also ship `docs/REPORT.md`:** a technical report (abstract, introduction, related work, method, experiments, results with intervals, limitations, ethics and disclosure, reproducibility) of 4,000 to 8,000 words, with figures generated from artifacts.
